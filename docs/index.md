# Job Manager

## Welcome

Welcome to our user-facing documentation for Job Manager!

The github repository documentation is pretty heavily biased towards developers, these
pages are intended to help you to:

- Get started with Job Manager!
- Learn how to deploy in a variety of situations

The easiest way to get started is to use the quick-start script!

## Try it out!

This script is not perfect but you should be able to get started by copying the following command into a terminal window and following the prompts:
`
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataBiosphere/job-manager/master/deploy/quickstart/quick_start.py > /tmp/jmui.py && python3 /tmp/jmui.py
`

Note: This quickstart script relies on the following being available before starting:

- Linux or MacOS based system
- Python 3
- docker
- docker-compose
- ifconfig (to provide a hint about your IP address)
