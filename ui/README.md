# Job Manager UI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Setup
Install the Angular CLI following the instructions in [Step 1](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart#devenv) of the Angular QuickStart guide.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use:
```
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running Tests
Unit tests are run via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Tests are typically run in CI after PR creation, not locally. 
To run them locally, CD into the `ui` directory and run:
```
npm test
```

By default, this opens a browser. Alternatively run headless:
```
npm test -- --browsers=ChromeHeadless
```

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
