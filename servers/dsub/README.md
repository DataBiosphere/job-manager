# Job Manager API Server: `dsub`

Thin shim around [`dsub`](https://github.com/googlegenomics/dsub).

## Development

Currently the Job Manager does not support starting jobs directly. This must be done through the `dsub` CLI (see [Getting Started](https://github.com/googlegenomics/dsub#getting-started) to get setup).

### `google`
1. See [Getting Started on Google Cloud](https://github.com/googlegenomics/dsub#getting-started-on-google-cloud) for setup instructions and examples on how to run jobs on [Google Cloud Platform](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+cloud+platform&oq=Google+Cloud+Platform&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60l3j0l2.2358j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
1. Ensure you have correctly set [Application Default
Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)
and logged into [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts).


### `local`
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
1. Create a local tmp directory for the `local` provider to store job data:
1. See [Getting Started With The Local Provider](https://github.com/googlegenomics/dsub#getting-started-with-the-local-provider) for examples on how to start local jobs.
```
mkdir /tmp/dsub-local
```

## Running Tests
To run unit and integration tests on the python-flask app, install
[`tox`](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox) or
[`detox`](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox) (recommended for `dsub`
integration tests with the Google provider). Integration tests with the google
provider also require access to the [bvdp-jmui-testing](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=bvdp-jmui-testing)
Google Cloud project. File a Github issue assigned to
[@bfcrampton](https://github.com/bfcrampton) to gain access.

```
cd servers/dsub
# Run all the tests
detox -- -s
# Run all local provider tests
detox jobs/test/test_jobs_controller_local.py
# Run specific local provider test
detox jobs/test/test_jobs_controller_local.py:TestJobsControllerLocal.test_abort_job
# Run only google provider tests
detox jobs/test/test_jobs_controller_local.py
# Run specific google provider test
detox jobs/test/test_jobs_controller_local.py:TestJobsControllerLocal.test_abort_job
```

## Generating `requirements.txt`

`requirements.txt` is autogenerated from `requirements-to-freeze.txt`. The
latter lists only direct dependencies. To regenerate run:
```
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2 /tmp/dsub-server-requirements
source /tmp/dsub-server-requirements/bin/activate
```
Then, from the dsub directory of this repo:
```
pip install -r requirements-to-freeze.txt
pip freeze | sort -f | sed 's/^jm-utils.*/\.\.\/jm_utils/g' > requirements.txt
deactivate
```

The sed command above replaces jm-utils=x.y.z with ../jm_utils, which is required
to allow pip to install from the local jm_utils directory.
