# Below is a link explaining why the PyYAML package is commented out
# https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/736#issuecomment-1653209769
# In short, due to Cython 3 being released, PyYAML needs to have it's Cython dependency contrained, otherwise it'll fail to install due to deprecated features
# However installation of PyYAML uses a "wheel", which is basically a pre-compiled version of the package
# This is problematic for requirements.txt as it cannot specify a wheel, only a source package
# So we need to install PyYAML separately with the constraint defined in constraints.txt via pip install as opposed to here
# You can see the above implemented in the Dockerfiles
# PyYAML==5.4
